<h1>Quoter</h1>
</hr>

<p>This application is more like a Twitter. But, the primary goal of this application is quite different from the Twitter. I have seen many users of social media who loves to post their writtings or quotes. Today's world is more involved in sharing something online, even the emotions by writting such things. Quoter is a great concept for such writters and shayars who actually loves to share. User can reach upto great audience easily if they are capable of writting something worth. So, writters! this is the best match for you to reach more audience :)</p>
